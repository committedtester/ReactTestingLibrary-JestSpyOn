**Key Notes**

- Use Jest for each individual piece of logic
- Use React Testing Library to confirm state of react elements in the react component with user interactions.
- Use Jest.spyOn to confirm that the payload being sent by the system is correct.
- Use Jest.spyon to introduce a mockImplementation that contains the data for the response. (This can contain both positive and negative scenarios)
-  Introduce aria-label attributes, to prevent use of classes and other hidden (non-user visible) elements


Potential Next Steps
- Look at replacing the Jest.spyon with PACT.js
